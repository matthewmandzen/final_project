      <h2>About Matthew Mandzen</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in the small town of Byron, Illinois and graduated from Stillman Valley High School. 
        Staying busy, I spent time playing basketball & baseball, participating in extra-curriculars, and making memories with friends and family.
      </p> 
      <p>
        My family includes my dad, Michael, and my mom, Kathy, who both work in the education field.
        Also, I have two older siblings named Erin & Andrew, who both work in the medical field in the Chicago area.
      </p> 
      <p>
        During my senior year of high school, I chose to attend the University of Iowa.
        In my freshman year, I obtained in-state residency for tuition purposes.
        Even with that, I will still graduate in four years. 
        Currently, I'm majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems, while gaining a certificate in Risk Management & Insurance.
        In June, I'll start working full-time as a Production Assistant at Brown & Riding Insurance in Chicago.
